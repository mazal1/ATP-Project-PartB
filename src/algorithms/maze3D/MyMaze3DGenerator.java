     * and set the value of the maze via the start position indexes as 0, creating a path in other words.
     * we push the start position to the stack.
     * while the stack isn't empty we pop the head of the stack and if the current position has at least 1 neighbour that
     * hasn't been visited yet, we add the current position to the stack check the number of walls surronding the current cell
     * randomly pick 1 neighbour from the unvisited neighbours and create a path.
     * we continue this process until the stack is empty.
     * pick "randomly" a goal position from a list of possibleGoal, set the value in the maze to 0 (using the indexes of
     * the goal position) and return the maze.
     * @depth - the depth of the maze
     * @row - the row of the maze in each depth
     * @column - the column of the maze in each depth.
     * @maze3D - Maze3D object, our 3D maze
     * @randomCellIndex = Random, using it to randomly pick a neighbour from the neighbour list.
     * @visited - a 3D boolean array corresponds with the maze3D size
     * @wallList - a Stack data structure, holds the unvisited positions in the maze
     * @possibleGoalCells - a List of possible goals we pick randomly at the end of the maze generation.
     * @neighbours - a list of unvisited neighbours to the currentCell
     * @start - the start Position3D of the maze
     * @currentCell - the current position we work with, the head of the stack.
     * @return - maze3D object after finishing creating the maze.*/
